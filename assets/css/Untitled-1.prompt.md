Let's continue the coding from where you stop.

> Copilot: I notice this is a photo booth business website project. Looking at the current index.html file, I can see we have a basic structure with a header, hero section, "Why Choose Us" section, and a footer. However, there are several key sections that would make the website more complete and engaging. Let me help you add more content.

The images are not properly distributed on the home page. The hero section is not perfect. (Pick with deep thought some other images to join the images we have on the hero slider. Also work on the overlay. The font on the hero section needs to be white.)



> Copilot: 

Add "about-booth.jpg" to the "About PSL3 Productions" section. 

on the "Events We Cater To" section, ensure the images in each box are displayed as cover to fit in well.

Make use of icons on the "Why Choose Us" section and add thin border to each box on the "Why Choose Us" section with a nice hover effect.

Add random images as profile img on the "What Our Clients Say" section cards.

Uplaod randomly images and make them dislay well on the "Recent Events" section. to be linked to the gallery page for full view.

Add image background to the "Ready to Make Your Event Unforgettable?" section and change specifically the word "Ready to Make Your Event Unforgettable?" to white color and also the "call us is not good in black. Change to white.

Improve so much the Footer. And the Header display across the website.

Lets do the same theme as it is on Home page. Can you just copy and paste the header from home page to the gallery page.   Copy and paste the code of CTA Section from Home page to the Gallery.

Do the same for the footer. Copy and paste the footer. 

Do overall touch on the gallery page.

The toggle icon color should be grey or somthing else. Its black and the same with the header background color. 

Also, the mobile menu dropdown should be displayed as contained. Its too wide, I prefer as it is on the home page mobile view.

Let's work on the footer on the gallery page. 

Also, on the Gallery page. When viewd on mobile the Toggle menu icon becomes black and rhymes with the background color of the header. Can we change the color. 

Also, work more on the mobile menu dropdown background and hover properties. Reduce the hieght of the menu drop down.
